        (1) Done with AWS EC2 On Linux AMI Server
        
        (2) a) PRIVATE KEY - Assume that the private key as being the actual key. This is what we use to open the
                             padlock that is stored on the other machine. Just a regular we keep it secret, safe
                             and out of the wrong hands.
                             
            b) PUBLIC KEY - Assume that the public key as being the lock. It's not actually a key, it's like a 
                            padlock.We can make lots of copies of public key and distribute wherever we want.
                            
            c) SSH KEY - To establish a secure connection between client (on local computer) and the remote repository. 
                            
        (3) sudo apt update
            sudo snap install docker
            
            a) Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.
               Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries
               and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package.
               
        (4) Use Laradock (Full PHP development environment for Docker)
        
        (5) Done
        
        (6) sudo docker-compose up -d gitlab
            a) Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared
               repository several times a day.
